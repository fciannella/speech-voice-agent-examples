# Healthcare Agent Tool Calling Improvements

## Summary

This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to the healthcare agent's tool calling system. The primary goal was to **harden tool usage** and **fix issues with secret question handling** by improving docstrings and system prompts.

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Vague Tool Docstrings**
- Original docstrings were too brief (e.g., "Find a patient_id by name. Returns JSON.")
- No guidance on WHEN to call each tool
- No explanation of parameter formats or return value interpretation
- Missing information about tool call sequences
- No examples showing expected inputs/outputs

### 2. **Secret Question Flow Issues** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
The `verify_identity` tool didn't clearly explain the multi-step secret question flow:
- When `verify_identity` returns a `question` field, the agent must ASK it to the caller
- The agent must then collect the answer and call `verify_identity` AGAIN with `secret_answer`
- This two-step process was not documented, causing authentication failures

### 3. **System Prompt Lacked Structure**
- The original prompt was a paragraph of instructions
- No clear step-by-step conversation flow
- Verification logic was not explicit
- Tool calling sequence was implied but not stated

## Solutions Implemented

### A. Enhanced Tool Docstrings

All 9 tools now have comprehensive docstrings with the following structure:

```
1. One-line summary
2. WHEN TO CALL: Exact timing/trigger for using this tool
3. PARAMETERS: Detailed explanation of each parameter with examples
4. RETURNS: JSON structure breakdown with field explanations
5. WHAT TO DO: Step-by-step instructions for handling the response
6. EXAMPLE: Real conversation flow showing inputs/outputs
```

### B. Tools Improved

#### 1. `find_patient`
- **Added**: Clear instruction to call this FIRST
- **Added**: Example showing full_name vs first_name/last_name usage
- **Added**: Next step guidance (call verify_identity after)

#### 2. `verify_identity` ⚠️ **MOST CRITICAL**
- **Added**: 7-step secret question flow example
- **Added**: Authentication logic explanation (DOB + MRN OR DOB + secret)
- **Added**: Explicit instructions: "YOU MUST read the question verbatim to the caller"
- **Added**: Example conversation showing the two-call pattern
- **Added**: Clear decision tree for handling responses

**Before:**
```python
"""Verify identity before accessing records. Provide any of: full_name, dob (YYYY-MM-DD or free-form), 
MRN last-4, secret answer. Returns JSON with verified flag, needed fields, and optional secret question."""
```

**After:**
```python
"""Verify caller identity before accessing medical records. CRITICAL: Identity verification is MANDATORY...
    
CRITICAL SECRET QUESTION FLOW:
1. First call: verify_identity(patient_id="pt_abc", dob_yyyy_mm_dd="1960-01-01")
2. Response: {"verified": false, "needs": ["mrn_last4_or_secret"], "question": "What is your favorite color?"}
3. YOU MUST: Read the question verbatim to the caller: "What is your favorite color?"
4. Collect their answer (e.g., "blue")
5. Second call: verify_identity(patient_id="pt_abc", dob_yyyy_mm_dd="1960-01-01", secret_answer="blue")
6. Response: {"verified": true, "needs": []}
"""
```

#### 3. `get_patient_profile_tool`
- **Added**: Warning to call ONLY after verified=true
- **Added**: CRITICAL flag for allergies (must check before medication recommendations)
- **Added**: Guidance on using profile data when giving medical advice

#### 4. `triage_symptoms_tool`
- **Added**: Risk level definitions (urgent/soon/self_care)
- **Added**: Decision tree for handling each risk level
- **Added**: Two detailed examples (urgent and self-care cases)
- **Added**: Reminder to consider allergies and current medications

#### 5. `list_providers_tool` & `get_provider_slots_tool` & `schedule_appointment_tool`
- **Added**: Clear sequence: list → slots → schedule
- **Added**: Guidance on presenting options naturally in voice conversation
- **Added**: Time formatting instructions (today at 8pm vs ISO timestamps)

#### 6. `get_preferred_pharmacy_tool`
- **Added**: When to call (before prescriptions)
- **Added**: Example confirmation dialogue

#### 7. `log_call_tool`
- **Added**: Call at END of conversation
- **Added**: What to include in notes
- **Added**: Example with full call summary

### C. Restructured System Prompt

The system prompt was completely restructured from a paragraph to a **7-step numbered flow**:

```
## CONVERSATION FLOW (follow this sequence):

1. GREETING
   - Call find_patient(full_name=...)

2. IDENTITY VERIFICATION (CRITICAL)
   - Explicit secret question handling:
     * If 'question' field present: READ THE EXACT QUESTION
     * Wait for answer
     * Call verify_identity again with secret_answer

3. AFTER VERIFIED=TRUE
   - Call get_patient_profile_tool()
   - Ask about symptoms

4. TRIAGE AND GUIDANCE
   - Call triage_symptoms_tool()
   - Handle based on risk level

5. APPOINTMENT BOOKING
   - list_providers → get_slots → schedule

6. PHARMACY CONFIRMATION

7. CLOSING
   - Call log_call_tool()
```

**Added sections:**
- Clear step-by-step conversation structure
- Explicit secret question instructions in prompt (redundant with tool, intentionally)
- Communication style guidelines
- TTS safety rules

## Key Improvements Summary

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Tool docstrings** | 1 line, no examples | 10-30 lines with WHEN/WHAT/HOW/EXAMPLE |
| **Secret question flow** | Implied | 7-step explicit instructions with example |
| **System prompt** | Paragraph | 7-step numbered flow with sub-bullets |
| **Error handling** | Not specified | Clear fallback instructions |
| **Examples** | None | Every tool has conversation examples |
| **Parameter guidance** | Minimal | Format examples and auto-injection notes |

## Testing Recommendations

To validate these improvements, test the following scenarios:

### 1. **Secret Question Flow** (Primary Fix)
```
Test: John Marshall
- User says: "John Marshall"
- User provides: "January 1st, 1960" (DOB)
- Agent should ASK: "For security, what is your favorite color?"
- User answers: "Blue"
- Agent should verify successfully

Expected: Agent asks the secret question and accepts the answer
```

### 2. **Wrong Secret Answer**
```
Test: John Marshall with wrong answer
- DOB: correct
- Secret answer: "red" (wrong - correct is "blue")

Expected: Agent explains verification failed, asks for MRN last-4 instead or re-attempts
```

### 3. **MRN Last-4 Alternative**
```
Test: John Marshall with MRN
- DOB: "January 1st, 1960"
- MRN last-4: "0001"

Expected: Agent verifies without asking secret question
```

### 4. **Triage Urgent Case**
```
Test: Francesco Ciannella with chest pain
- Symptoms: "I have severe chest pain and I'm short of breath"

Expected: 
- Agent calls triage_symptoms_tool
- Gets risk="urgent"
- Immediately directs to ER/911
- Does NOT offer regular appointment
```

### 5. **Allergy Check**
```
Test: John Marshall with headache
- Has Penicillin allergy
- Currently takes Acetaminophen PRN

Expected: 
- Agent retrieves profile
- Mentions "Since you're already taking acetaminophen as needed and have a penicillin allergy..."
- Doesn't recommend penicillin-based meds
```

### 6. **Full Flow End-to-End**
```
Test: Complete call with Francesco Ciannella
1. Name lookup
2. DOB verification
3. Secret question: "What city were you born in?" → "rome"
4. Profile retrieved (Lisinopril, no known allergies)
5. Symptoms: "mild headache and fatigue"
6. Triage returns self_care
7. Books appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow 8:30am
8. Confirms pharmacy
9. Logs call

Expected: Smooth flow with no repeated questions, proper tool sequence
```

## Files Modified

1. **`tools.py`** - All 9 tool docstrings completely rewritten
2. **`prompts.py`** - Healthcare system prompt moved here (refactored from react_agent.py)
3. **`react_agent.py`** - Now imports SYSTEM_PROMPT from prompts.py
4. **`README.md`** - Added note about improvements and visual flow diagram
5. **`IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - This document
6. **`TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - New comprehensive testing guide

## Code Organization

The system prompt has been properly organized following best practices:

**Before**: System prompt was inline in `react_agent.py` (cluttering the main logic)

**After**: 
- System prompt is now in `prompts.py` as `HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- `react_agent.py` imports it cleanly: `SYSTEM_PROMPT = hc_prompts.HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- This follows the pattern used in other agents and makes prompt maintenance easier
- Future prompts (e.g., for different specialties or languages) can be added to `prompts.py`

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are backward compatible**
- No function signatures changed
- No breaking changes to logic.py
- Only docstrings and prompt text modified
- Existing calls will continue to work
- Prompt refactoring is transparent to the agent's behavior

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If further hardening is needed, consider:

1. **Add tool call validation** - Reject calls to medical tools before verification
2. **Add structured logging** - Log tool call sequences for debugging
3. **Add conversation state tracking** - Explicit state machine (NOT_VERIFIED → VERIFIED → TRIAGED → SCHEDULED)
4. **Add retry limits** - Max 3 verification attempts before ending call
5. **Add mock data validation** - Ensure test patients have valid data

## Conclusion

The healthcare agent now has **enterprise-grade tool documentation** with:
- ✅ Clear, explicit instructions for every tool
- ✅ Fixed secret question authentication flow
- ✅ Step-by-step conversation structure
- ✅ Comprehensive examples
- ✅ Error handling guidance

This should significantly improve the agent's reliability and reduce authentication errors.
