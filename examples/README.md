# NVIDIA Pipecat Examples

### Voice Assitant Example
In this example, we showcase how to build a simple speech-to-speech voice assistant pipeline using nvidia-pipecat along with pipecat-ai library and deploy for testing. This pipeline uses a Websocket based ACETransport, Riva ASR and TTS models and NVIDIA LLM Service.

Follow the instructions from [the example directory](./speech-to-speech/README.md) for more details.
