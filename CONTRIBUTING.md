# Contributing Guidelines

Use the following guidelines to contribute to this project.


## Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of this repository for the upstreaming.
2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.
3. Developers must run changes locally to make sure formatting, linting, and unit test checks pass. Check steps for development with the source in [README.md](./README.md) for more details.
3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a Pull Request (PR) can be requested to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
4. If you are contributing for the first time, Download [Contribution License Agreement(CLA)](CLA.md) and email a signed CLA to [ttripathi@nvidia.com](mailto:ttripathi@nvidia.com).
5. Since there is no CI/CD process in place yet, the PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed only after adequate testing has been completed, manually, by the developer and/or repository owners reviewing the code.
